# Pangandaran Project: Smart Coconut Plantation
# Introduction

We see that some of our coconut farmers are having problems with their growing media. They cannot monitor the level of soil fertility in an exact manner so that they cannot provide proper care to the soil. From these problems we tried to make the device that we designed ergonomically. Farmers can use this tool easily and quick results with accuracy can be accounted for.

# The Device

We made this device using a microcontroller from the Arduino family, the Arduino Nano. We use analog pins to get data like
fertility,
pH
Light intensity,
soil moisture
simultaneously. The data is processed and displayed on a 64x64 LCD screen. Regarding the power source, we use a Lipo 3.7 V 800 mAh battery and add a charger module to recharge. We also added a Bluetooth communication module to send data from devices to smart devices, such as Android phones.

# The Tools

To make it easy to use, we recommend that you install the Arduino IDE. You can easily upload code using the device to the microcontroller that you are using.

# The Schematic

We make board designs that we have integrated with other devices. You can use Eagle CAD or KiCAD software to see the schematics we made.

# We Are Open To Discuss

We really hope to continue this product until we can distribute this device to a wider market. Therefore we expect your support. You can contact me through my email. All your support is very helpful for us.
